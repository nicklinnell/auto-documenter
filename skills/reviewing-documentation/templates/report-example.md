**Generated**: 2025-10-17

## Summary
- Total significant files: 45
- Documented files: 12
- Coverage: 27%

## Well-Documented Areas ‚úÖ
- Authentication System - docs/features/authentication.md
- API Routing - docs/features/api-routing.md
- Hook System - docs/features/hook-system.md

## Undocumented Areas ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Critical (Document Immediately)
- Payment Processing (src/payments/) - Handles money, complex logic, no docs
- User Permissions (src/auth/permissions.ts) - Security-critical, needs gotchas

### Important (Document Soon)
- Database Migrations (migrations/) - Team needs migration guide
- Email Templates (src/email/) - Business logic in templates

## Documentation Quality Issues üîß
- features/api-routing.md - Last updated 6 months ago, API has changed
- Broken link in README.md pointing to deleted gotchas/old-system.md

## Recommendations
1. Document payment processing immediately using document-feature skill
2. Update api-routing.md with recent changes
3. Run maintain-index skill to fix broken links
4. Consider documenting database migrations for team onboarding
